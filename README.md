# LemonMod
A MooMoo.io utility client that automated a number of in-game actions and allowed me to reign superior over other players.

An update to the game in 2023 finally cracked down and patched most utility clients like this one.

I had already discontinued development of the mod before it was patched, so no measures were taken to circumvent the patch.
