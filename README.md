# LemonMod
A MooMoo.io utility client that automated a number of in-game actions and allowed me to reign superior over other players.

An update to the game in 2023 finally cracked down and patched most utility clients like this one.

I had already discontinued development of the mod before it was patched, so no measures were taken to circumvent the patch.

Attached below are screenshots & videos of the mod in various states of development during its life cycle. Additionally, you will find earlier versions of the mod (1.X) featured in many YouTube videos on moomoo.io. However, those early versions of the mod were not very strong and frequently lost in HvH (hacks vs. hacks) fights.
